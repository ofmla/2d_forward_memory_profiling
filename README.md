# Memory profiling of 2D forward modeling using Devito

This repository provides simple Python implementations of 2D forward modeling for acoustic media. The implementations are based on the [Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/) and [Dask](https://dask.org/) libraries. The [h5py](https://github.com/h5py/h5py), [segyio](https://github.com/equinor/segyio) packages are also used, along with the 2D Marmousi model for testing. The main goal here is to monitor the memory during the execution of the modeling using the [memory-profile](https://pypi.org/project/memory-profiler/) tool.

In a nutshell, this is the full python packages required

+ devito
+ segyio
+ h5py
+ memory_profiler
+ PyYAML
+ dask-jobqueue

## Install dependencies  
To install [devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/) follow the instructions from [Devito documentation](https://www.devitoproject.org/devito/download.html). I recommend to set up a python environment with conda as also suggested in the [installation web page](https://www.devitoproject.org/devito/download.html#conda-environment) 
```
git clone https://github.com/devitocodes/devito.git
cd devito
conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
source activate devito
pip install -e .
```  
All other packages (i.e. [dask jobqueue](https://github.com/dask/dask-jobqueue), [segyio](https://github.com/equinor/segyio)) can be easily installed via `pip` once you have activated the devito environment. To install them, run the following:
```
pip install segyio
pip install dask-jobqueue --upgrade
pip install h5py
pip install PyYAML
pip install memory-profiler
```

## Forward modeling

You can generate synthetic seismic data in parallel or sequential way. Aditionally, you can choose between to use the `AcousticWaveSolver` Class from the Devito's folder `examples` or a Devito `Operator`. Thus, there are four possible options for generating the shot gathers:

1. Forward modeling for all the shots in sequential using the `AcousticWaveSolver` [Class](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/examples/seismic/acoustic/wavesolver.py#L9)
2. Forward modeling for all the shots in sequential using a Devito `Operator` (such as that in [tutorial 1](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/examples/seismic/tutorials/01_modelling.ipynb))
3. Forward modeling for all the shots in parallel in a dask cluster using the `AcousticWaveSolver` [Class](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/examples/seismic/acoustic/wavesolver.py#L9)
4. Forward modeling for all the shots in parallel in a dask cluster using a Devito `Operator` (such as that in [tutorial 1](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/examples/seismic/tutorials/01_modelling.ipynb))

The parameters used in the modeling are defined in a YAML file (`config.yaml`) in the `config` folder. It includes parameters for configuring the geometry and the absolute paths of the folders where the physical parameters (in [hdf5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5) format) will be read and generated shots (in [segy](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/SEG-Y) format) will be stored. These paths are set in the variables `parfile_path` and `shotfile_path` of the dictionary `solver_params`. Further control parameters are specified in the dictionary, including the minimum and maximum recording times `t0` and `tn`, sampling rate `dt`, peak frequency `f0`, order of accuracy of the finite difference scheme for spatial derivatives `space_order`, number of layers of the absorbing boundary condition `nbl` and floating-point precision to be used by Devito in code generation. In these settings you can decide whether or not to use an instance of the `AcousticWaveSolver` to produce the seismic data. Specify a boolean value (true/false) in the `use_solver` key, in according with the case.

To run in parallel you need set up the dask cluster in `config.yaml`. Depending on available hardware, you can launch a local Dask cluster (on your laptop or single computing node) or a non-local one (on a distributed HPC with job scheduler installed). In latter case I only support an HPC cluster which uses the SLURM scheduler, but you can change this easily. Set `use_local_cluster` to `false` or `true`, depending of the hardware. Here are the settings for running the forward modeling of 184 shots for the Marmousi model, on a quad core laptop (i.e., Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @1.80GHz)

``` yaml
# dask cluster
use_local_cluster: True
queue: "GPUlongB"
project: "cenpes-lde"
n_workers: 4
cores: 1
processes: 1
memory: 2
shot_batch_size: 4
extra_job:
  - '-e slurm-%j.err'
  - '-o slurm-%j.out'
  - '--time=72:00:00'
  - '--requeue'
  - '--job-name="dask-modeling"'
```
To optimize the processing of a large number of shots, we divided them into batches. The number of shots per batch is set in `shot_batch_size` and is equal to the number of workers `n_workers`. If the local cluster configuration is used, the `memory` key represents the memory limit (in GB) per worker processes. On the contrary, it represents the total amount of memory (in GB) that the code could possibly use (not the memory per worker). For the local cluster configuration, only `n_workers` and `memory` parameters are of interest.  The keys `queue`, `project` and `extra_job` are meaningful only in the case of non-local cluster usage.

### How to run the tests

After the configuration is completed, you can profile each of the options provided in the above list using `GNU Make`. To do so, you can run `make` with the specific target for each option. For first and second options, use
```
make serial.solver
```
and
```
make serial.operator
```
In the case of the third and fourth options
```
make dask.solver
```
and
```
make dask.operator
```

In each case, check the `shotfile_path` folder to see the generated segy files. After finishing the modeling process for each option, you can plot the recorded memory usage running the `mprof plot` command for the files generated (in date time format). You should obtain figures such as the following:

In the parallel case is possible to see a remarkable increase in the memory for both cases, when `Operator` as `AcousticWaveSolver` class are used. Although, each dask task (dedicated to the modeling of one shot) creates its own `Operator` or `solver` according to the case, I did not expect for a such increasing because theoretically the memory should be released after each function call. 

For serial case I initially found results somewhat curious. When the `Operator` was used, the memory remained almost constant over time, but when an `AcousticWaveSolver` instance was created and the class method `forward` was called repeatedly, the level of memory increased significantly. Since the memory comsumption was not approximately the same in both cases, I considered the possibility of the `AcousticWaveSolver` class was not working as expected. After some experiments I came to realize that the creation of `(Sparse)TimeFunctions` by the `forward` method was the cause of the growth in memory (it is more than likely related to the issue [#845](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/issues/845)). Fortunately, I sorted out the problem by reusing those objects and arrived to the same memory comsumption obtained by using the `Operator`.
